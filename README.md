# MythicMobs - Jeff
This is my first custom mob which is created by using the Minecraft Plugin "MythicMobs". The mob has two phases and is surrounded by a slownessaura which slows you down all the time. In the first phase the mob can grab one towards him and shoot a lot of arrows while jumping. In the second phase the mob will dash towards one and will attack with a firebeam.

**Requirements:**
- Minecraft Java (https://www.minecraft.net/)
- Java (https://www.java.com/)

**How to use the mob?**
To use the mob, ones needs to create a server where one can use MythicMobs. I recommend to use a local paper server:
These following link will show, how to config a local paper server for Windows and macOS:

After one either create a local server or bought a server, one need download the MythicMobs Plugin (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/⚔-mythicmobs-free-version-►the-1-custom-mob-creator◄.5702/). Then you need to drag certain files to certain folders:
- drag jeff.yml to ~/Plugins/MythicMobs/Mobs 
- drag JeffSkills.yml to ~/Plugins/MythicMobs/Skills
- drag jeffdrops.yml ~/Plugins/MythicMobs/droptables

Finally use the floowing command in your server to spawn the mob:
```
/mm m spawn Jeff
```
